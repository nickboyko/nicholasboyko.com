i'm a recent graduate of NYU, where i obtained both a master's and a bachelor's degree in Music Technology, along with a minor in Mathematics. i'm passionate about challenges at the intersection of signal processing, sound engineering, and machine learning. 

i enjoy audio programming, signal processing, and acoustics, and am always excited to extend my interests specifically into music. i have completed coursework in Python, C++, and Java; musical, creative, and technical sound; and rigorous, proof-based mathematics.
